# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

> The Collection of Algorithms and Data-Structures.

## Overview:
This repo is a collection of algorithms for competitive programming, data structure, sorting and related areas. It contains many advanced algorithms like greedy, graph traversal algorithms, including Djikstra's algorithm and Floyd Warshal algorithm, and data structures like queues, stacks, and binary search trees including their Operations and Helper Functions. Contributions are highly appreciated.

Use these following repos to study or review your knowledge and don't forget to star and colaborate!

## How to contribute:

 Please comment your code thoroughly as to make it possible for anyone understand.
 If possible, check your code using unit tests.
 Avoid at all cost bad implementation, make your code as clean as possible.
 After that, find the folder that fits the category of your code and submit a PR.
